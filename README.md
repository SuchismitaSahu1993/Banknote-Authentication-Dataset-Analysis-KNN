# Banknote-Authentication-Dataset-Analysis-KNN
Banknote Authentication Dataset is used for Exploratory Analysis and KNN algorithm is used to classify and experimentation is done with different parameters for optimization and performance analysis.

## Parameters Tested:
1. Value of K
2. Distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Mahalanobis, Chebyshev)
3. Decisions (majority polling & weighted decision)

## Evaluation Metrics:
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Learning Curve
